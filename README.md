# ArchiFarm
ArchiFarm is a framework designed to assist software architects in exploring and evaluating the architectural design space through Data Farming (DF). It aims to help architects make informed design decisions by quantitatively assessing the impact of various design options on quality attributes (QAs) like scalability and resilience.
